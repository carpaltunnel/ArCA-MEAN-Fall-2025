<!--
    This is the core element used by impress.js: the wrapper for your presentation steps. 
    In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    
    data-transition-duration sets the time in microseconds that is used for the
    animation when transtitioning between slides.
    
    The width, height, scale and perspective options define a target screen size that you should
    design your CSS against. impress.js will automatically scale all content to different screen
    sizes. See DOCUMENTATION.md for details. Below, I have targeted full HD screen resolution.
    
    data-autoplay can be used to set the time in seconds, after which presentation
    automatically moves to next slide. It can also be set individually for each
    slide, but here we just set a common duration for all slides.

    <!--
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        This step is auto-assigned the id "step-1". You can also use `#step-1` in a link, to 
        point directly to this particular step.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data-* attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not 
        be rotated or scaled.
        
        The "step" class is what *must* be used for every "slide". In this example we also use the "slide"
        class, which adds a rectangle with some background and makes this presentation look like a traditional
        powerpoint slide show. The "slide" class is entirely optional and indeed you wouldn't use it for
        your cooler impress.js presentations.

        <p>So far we've just output plain, human readable, sentences.  This is friendly

            quickly.  We should use key value pairs or JSON so that logs can be easily parsed and searched.

        Winston is a logging framework that goes far beyond what <code>console</code> can do.  It introduces more logging levels, supports multiple "transports", and is easily configurable / extensible.

        <h1>Console or Winston?</h1>

        <p>So the question is, do you actually need Winston?  Maybe, maybe not.  For small projects it is probably overkill and just more dependency bulk.  For larger projects it will allow you to enforce a consistent log format and it provides a lot of niceties that you would otherwise need to implement yourself.</p>

        <h1>Log Rotation</h1>
        <p>In any long running application you're going to find the need for log file rotation.  This is simply writing to a new file at predetermined times.  Rotating the log file daily is pretty common but very high usage, or particularly chatty, applications might benefit from hourly rotation.</p>

        <h1>Performance Considerations</h1>
        <br />
        <p>Just because you're logging at "info" level doesn't mean your "debug" level log calls are free.
            While overhead should be pretty minimal, keep in mind that you are spending cycles on <strong>not</strong> outputting logs.

    <!-- This last, empty "slide" is set to be very large using the data-scale attribute, 
         so that it covers all the other slides you just saw. 
         It's a common way of zooming out at the end, to show the whole presentation.
         In CSS, we set pointer-events:none to make this slide non-clickable. 
         It makes a difference at least for SVG content, such as the mermaid diagram. -->
